## Getting Started
This code lets you take the results of a product survey using JTBD and find hidden clusters in the data to help you build better more focused products

## Prerequisites
You just need Python and a few libraries to run

### Check Python Installation

1. Python comes preinstalled on most computers ([download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if not). On Windows open [console/terminal](https://www.howtogeek.com/235101/10-ways-to-open-the-command-prompt-in-windows-10) and on Mac open [terminal](https://www.howtogeek.com/682770/how-to-open-the-terminal-on-a-mac/) and type:
   ```python
   python --version
   ```

2. Write a test program to output some text:
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```
